2 string by s and t
- t: generated randomly by shuffling string s and add one more letter at random position
- s: just a string

Return the letter that is added to t 


Spoiler:
Best solution
For ascii stirng, shuffling does not change the "sum" of characters 

the difference in the sum is the added ascii  character
